Here is a piece of OWL that should be readable in the documentation and in the
OMN output.

% Class: FirstClass

\omn{first.pomn}

Here is a piece of OWL that should be readable in the OMN output but is to
boring to be worth of consideration for the documentation. 

% \ignore{
%   \begin{omn}
%     Class: BoringOWL
%   \end{omn}
% }

\ignore{\omn{second.pomn}}

Here is a piece of broken OWL that should be rendered in the documentation (as
broken!) but should be ignored in the OMN. 

% \begin{notomn}
% Clazz: BrokenOmn
