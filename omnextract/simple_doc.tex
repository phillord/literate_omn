OMN output. 

\begin{owl}
Class: Thing
\end{owl}

\owl{owl.pomn}

Here is a piece of OWL that should be readable in the OMN output but is to
boring to be worth of consideration for the documentation. 

\ignore{
  \begin{owl}
    Class: BoringOWL
  \end{owl}
}

\ignore{\owl{owl.pomn}}

Here is a piece of broken OWL that should be rendered in the documentation (as
broken!) but should be ignored in the OMN. 

\begin{notowl}
Clazz: BrokenOwl
\end{notowl}
